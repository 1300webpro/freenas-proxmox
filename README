FreeNAS ZFS over iSCSI interface

Please be aware that this enhancment uses the FreeNAS API's and NOT the ssh/scp
like the other interface provide.

1) First use the following commands to patch the needed files forthe FreeNAS Interface
 patch /usr/share/pve-manager/js/pvemanagerlib.js < pve-manager/js/pvemanagerlib.js.patch
 patch /usr/share/perl5/PVE/Storage/ZFSPlugin.pm < perl5/PVE/Storage/ZFSPlugin.pm.patch
 patch /usr/share/pve-docs/api-viewer/apidoc.js < pve-docs/api-viewer/apidoc.js.patch

2) Use the following commands to copy the needed files for the FreeNAS 
 mkdir -p /usr/share/perl5/REST
 cp perl5/REST/Client.pm /usr/share/perl5/REST/Client.pm
 cp perl5/PVE/Storage/LunCmd/FreeNAS.pm /usr/share/perl5/PVE/Storage/LunCmd/FreeNAS.pm

3) Edit /usr/bin/pvedaemon and remove the '-T' from the perl command line.
 vi /usr/bin/pvedaemon
Not really sure about 'why' this is do I need to do some research on this PERL 
directive option.

4) Execute the following at a console command prompt to active the above
 systemctl restart pvedaemon

5) Either goto the URL for the Proxmox GUI in your favorite browser
   or
   If you are already logged in via the GUI just refresh your browser to receive
   the new Javascript code.
